# Introduction
A Scala3/Cumcumber/sbt boiler plate

This repo is a simple Scala3 repo used as a boiler plate for Cucumber BDD.

It has a single feature and single implementation for it along with a configured test runner.

It is primarily meant to be driven from the CLI e.g. ```sbt test```

The dependency ```"com.novocode" % "junit-interface"``` is required for this to run from ```sbt test```
